## This mod started as a rebalance of Sharky's Plants Plus Mod but has expanded to include QOL features

Hybrid of Earth's and Europa's plants has become possible thanks to scientists using advanced genetic modification techniques.

Adds more type of seeds to plant, that can be bought from the Research Outposts or found on wrecks if you're lucky. Plants will occasionally drop additonal seeds that you can plant or sell.

Contains:
- Aquatic Poppy - Produces Poppy Fruit which deconstructs into opium
- Elastin Plant - Produces Elastin
- Fiber Plant   - Produces Organic Fiber
- Sea Wheat - Produces Ethanol
- Slime Bacteria - Produces Slime Bacteria Spore which deconstructs into Antibiotics

### Quality of Life changes include
Plant related items prefer to be placed in a container tagged "plantcab" to make NPCs cleanup task more useful. Custom subs can make use of this.
Small Planters now require a wrench to remove from walls.
Plant products are combinable so if part of your crops rot you can salvage something from it.

### Features that I would like to add in the future
Add a Trowel tool that is required to uproot plants so you can't do it accidently.
Add additonal processing steps to remaining plants.
