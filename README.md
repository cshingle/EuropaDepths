## Europa Depths Items

Now updated for version 0.20.16

[h1]Europa Depths[/h1]
[h2]Now with %100 More Pressure Resistent Clowns[h2]
Europa Depths Items adjusts the balance of items in the game. It is created with the following principals.
[list]
[*]Every item should be useful.
[*]Fabrication and deconstruction should allow experimentation.
[*]Balance the buying as selling economy to make more sense.
[*]Items should have a similar power balance to vanilla.
[*]Items should add requirements to bring new challenges.
[*]Items should make boring tasks faster.
[*]Don't make stuipd balance choices just to avoid fractional items
[/list]

[list]

## Europa Depths NPCs
[h1]Description[/h1]
Tired of one player killing everything on the abandon station before anyone else is out of the armory?

Europa Depths NPCs adjusts the load outs and balance of NPC characters to make Pirates and Abandoned Outposts more challenging.

Abandon outposts will now be a fun and challenging mission rather than just a turkey shoot. I recommend disabling destructible stations for maximum fun.

Elite Pirates are a major threat. Engaging them in CQC will likely end in your death.

## Europa Depths NPCs Lite
This is a varient of Europa Depths NPCs that ajusts the abandon outpost missions, but does not override the outpostnpcs1 and abandonedoutpostnpcs sets to be more compatible with other mods that do override these NPC sets like Enhanced Armaments.

## Europa Depths Events
Updated for 0.20.16.1

[h1]Description[/h1]

Put the Trauma back in Barotrauma?

Europa Depths Trauma adds additional monster spawns to bring more challenge to the game.
This increases the number of monsters that spawn per event and increases the number of spawn events.
This mod also introduces dire missions that are much harder than standard missions.

This mod entirely replaces the reandomevents_campaign.xml with a fully custom one to give a new and consistent experience. Due to this This mod should work with mods that do not override the reandomevents_campaign.xml such as BaroTraumatic.

## Europa Depths Equipment
Europa Depths Equipment adds items that can be placed on custom subs. This mod can be used as a dependency for custom subs.

It currently contains the following items;
*Large Cabinet - A large version of the medical cabinet that can hold smallitem, mediumitem
*Large Shelf - A large cabinet that uses the Large Shelf decal. Holds 36 smallitem, mediumitem
*Welding Fuel Cabinet - Holds 3 welding fuel tanks and will slowly fill them if powered.
*Large Railgun Shell Rack - Holds 12 Railgun Rounds
*Large Ammunition Shelf - Holds 4 ammobox, coilgunammo, depthchargeammo
*Crate Shelf (No Cargo) - Create Shelf that will not get filled with cargo for cargo missions
*Distiller - Slowly produces Ethanol. Remaining in the Use GUI will cause the player Character to get more and more drunk. Some drunk submariners claim that it also has healing capabilities.

## Europa Depths Vanilla Monsters
Europa Depths Vanilla Monsters allows additional mosters to enter the sub

Note: I removed Endworms and Molochs because they killed frame rates and caused glitches.
