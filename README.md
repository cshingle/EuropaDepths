# EuropaDepths
Europa Depths is a balance mod for Barotrauma. It is split up into several optional components.

## Europa Depths Items

Europa Depths Items adjusts the balance of items in the game. It is created with the following principals.
* Every item should be useful.
* Fabrication and deconstruction should allow experimentation.

## Europa Depths NPCs
Europa Depths NPCs adjusts the load outs and balance of NPC characters to make Pirates and Abandoned Outposts more challenging.
All bandits have some kind of weapon and are an actual threat.
Elite Pirates are a major threat.

## Europa Depths NPCs Lite
This is a varient of Europa Depths NPCs that ajusts the abandon outpost missions, but does not override the outpostnpcs1 and abandonedoutpostnpcs sets to be more compatible with other mods that do override these NPC sets like Enhanced Armaments.

## Europa Depths Events
Europa Depths Events adds additional monster spawns to bring more challenge to the game.
This increases the number of monsters that spawn per event and increases the number of events.
This mod also introduces dire missions that are much harder than standard missions.

This mod should work with event mods that do not override the reandomevents_campaign.xml such as BaroTraumatic.

## Europa Depths Equipment
Europa Depths Equipment adds items that can be placed on custom subs. This mod can be used as a dependency for custom subs.

It currently contains the following items;
*Large Cabinet - A large version of the medical cabinet that can hold smallitem, mediumitem
*Large Shelf - A large cabinet that uses the Large Shelf decal. Holds 36 smallitem, mediumitem
*Welding Fuel Cabinet - Holds 3 welding fuel tanks and will slowly fill them if powered.
*Large Railgun Shell Rack - Holds 12 Railgun Rounds
*Large Ammunition Shelf - Holds 4 ammobox, coilgunammo, depthchargeammo
*Crate Shelf (No Cargo) - Create Shelf that will not get filled with cargo for cargo missions
*Distiller - Slowly produces Ethanol. Remaining in the Use GUI will cause the player Character to get more and more drunk. Some drunk submariners claim that it also has healing capabilities.
*Unit Load Device - Overrode the default Unit Load Device to hold 12 crates rather than 10.
