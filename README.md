# EuropaDepths
Europa Depths is a balance mod for Barotrauma. It is split up into several optional components.

## Europa Depths Items

Europa Depths Items adjusts the balance of items in the game. It is created with the following principals.
* Every item should be useful.
* Fabrication and deconstruction should allow experimentation.
* Balance the buying as selling economy to make more sense.
* Items should have a similar power balance to vanilla.
* Items should add requirements to bring new challenges.
* Items should make boring tasks faster.

Short list of current features:
* Deconstruction recipes updated
* Shorter radio range
* Additional Engineering Headset with longer range but takes batteries
* Suits now take batteries for lights and long range radios
* Suits now have additional small item slots (no stacking)
* All small arms ammunition produces a full load or full stack unless noted
* Harpoons produce 4 per steel
* Nearly all items excluding small arms ammunition is deconstructable
* Container for transporting Volatile Fuel Rods
* Cargo Scooter has limited ability to carry heavier items
* Cargo Scooter has a light when in water (to make it easier to find)
* Additional Harpoon type
* Additional Assault Rifle ammo type
* Additional Hand Cannon ammo type
* Additional Coingun ammo type
* Additional 40mm EMP Grenade ammo
* EMP weapons will slow and damage Ancient Aliens
* Ruin Artifact Holders can contain artifacts when not doing an artifact mission
* Additional Unique clown diving mask with unique art (Mother's Tangency)
* Modified the turretdecreasepowerconsumption upgrade to make Supercaps more efficent
* Additional Overvolt Turrets upgrade that greatly increases turret fire rate and power usage
* Small buff to stun weapons
* Narrow the beams on the tri-lazer from 20 to 15
* Added Medic Helmet

## Europa Depths NPCs
Europa Depths NPCs adjusts the loadouts and balance of NPC charators to make Pirates and Abandoned Outposts more challanging.
All bandits have some kind of weapon and are an acual threat.
Elite Pirates are a major threat.

## Europa Depths Events
Europa Depths Events adds additional monster spawns to bring more challange to the game.
This increases the number of monsters that spawn per event and increases the number of events.
This mod also introduces dire missions that are much harder than standard missions.

This mod should work with event mods that do not override the reandomevents_campaign.xml such as BaroTraumatic. Combining this with other spawner mods like BaroTraumatic may bring tears.
